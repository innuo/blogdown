<p>Let me offer an analogy that might make the distinctions between the UBI, JG and SWI a little more stark. Like any analogy this one has its boundary of applicability which I will try not to breach.</p>
<p>Imagine that scientists have discovered the soils in the backyards of most homes constantly produce a chemical - let’s call it humanium - which if left underground will over a few decades degrade into toxins that cause severe societal health issues.</p>
<p>Incidentally humanium can be a useful alternative raw material for certain health products that society desires, some of which have a much cheaper alternative raw material, called automatum. While humanium from backyards with higher densities could be extracted profitably and sold to the manufacturers of the health products there are many backyards where this is inefficient and automatum only keeps getting cheaper.</p>
<p>Because of the high cost and inefficiency of the extraction process in many backyards (due to lower densities in certain soils) there is no way this problem will be addressed by the market before it is too late. (Just in case it isn’t obvious, let me state that I had to make up the concept of humanium soil density to make the analogy work and not to imply any distinctions between the fundamental worth of any two human beings.)</p>
<p>The lack of market solutions in sight prompts the government to take action. The following proposals are made by economists to effectively solve this impending crisis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulate and subsidize. This proposal</li>
<li>Fixed payment program. The government offers fixed cash payment for all households under the assumption that they would apply it to the extraction of the chemical.</li>
<li>Humanium purchase plan. The government offers a fixed purchase price for humanium directly to home-owners which they can accept if they are unable to find buyers offering higher price.</li>
<li>Subsidy for humanium-based health products. Manufacturers of humanium based health products get reiumbursed a portion of their raw material costs.</li>
</ul>
