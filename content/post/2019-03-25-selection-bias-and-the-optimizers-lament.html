<p><em>Wherein I introduce and explain the well-studied mechanism behind the pervasive phenomenon in life of things being just a bit worse than expected. I will walk through some of the discussion in two excellent articles, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce61/396a4abe1da265f4b5d3f05d11fd206c40f7.pdf">The Optimizer’s Curse: Skepticism and Postdecision Surprise in Decision Analysis</a> by Smith and Winkler and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.7175.pdf">Estimating the Maximum Expected Value: An Analysis of (Nested) Cross Validation and the Maximum Sample Average</a> by van Hasselt.</em></p>
<p>Have you noticed that the checkout lanes you choose at the grocery store tends to be slower than you expected, the products you order off Amazon disappoint, and your second dates are not as exciting as your firsts? If you have, and suspect that the universe is conspiring against you, let me assure you that your suspicions are well-founded. The fundamental laws of probability have indeed been arrayed to scupper your satisfaction. If you haven’t noticed any such conspiracy, I congratulate you on either your consistent practice of Zen Buddhism or on your finely tuned skepticism about things.</p>
<p>The mechanism that may explain this seeming conspiracy, phenomena as diverse as the the replication crisis in social sciences and oil wells producing below expectations, and also superstitions like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx is what Smith and Winker call <em>Optimizer’s Curse</em>. Let’s look a bit closer at the mechanism (using notation slightly different from Smith and Winkler).</p>
<p>Imagine that you are selecting from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> options, <span class="math inline">\(1, \ldots, n\)</span>. Let the <em>true</em> values of these <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> options to you be as the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mu = (\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_n)\)</span>. If these true values were known to you, then you would choose option <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m = \mbox{argmax}_i\, \mu_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead assume that you only have <em>estimates</em> (<span class="math inline">\(V = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)\)</span>) of the true values. Further assume that the estimates are <em>unbiased</em>. That is, on average each <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> neither overestimates nor underestimates its corresponding true value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span>. An obvious strategy now is for you choose to go with option <span class="math inline">\(k = \mbox{argmax}_i\, v_i\)</span>. That is, you select the option that has the largest estimate of value. After the choice is made, the true value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_k\)</span> is revealed to you. We want to know what the <em>surprise</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mu_k - v_k\)</span> is, on average.</p>
<p>We have <span class="math display">\[\mu_k - v_k \leq \mu_k - v_m \leq \mu_m - v_m\]</span> The first inequality is because <span class="math inline">\(v_k \geq v_m\)</span> (that’s why you chose option <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and the second inequality is because <span class="math inline">\(\mu_m \geq \mu_k\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(m^{th}\)</span> option is the best (unbeknowst to you.)</p>
<p>Now taking expectations with respect to <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[ E[\mu_k - v_k ] \leq E[\mu_m - v_m] = 0\]</span> The equality of the second term to zero is due to our assumption that the estimates are all (and in particular the <span class="math inline">\(m^{th}\)</span> one is) unbiased. The expected surprise is therefore non-positive. In fact, it is zero only when the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(k = m) = 1\)</span>. That is, if there is a chance that you can make a wrong choice based on the estimates, then your suprises are on average unpleasant.</p>
<div id="disappointment-mitigation" class="section level2">
<h2>Disappointment Mitigation</h2>
<p>If you knew that the true values are being generated from a <em>known</em> distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(\mu)\)</span>, the bias can be <em>completely</em> eliminated by turning the Bayesian crank.</p>
<p>In this case the <em>generative model</em> for our problem can be written as (read <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> “is distributed as”) <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mu &amp;\sim P(\mu)\\
v_i &amp;\sim P(.| \mu_i)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The procedure to follow under this model is to first estimate the posterior means <span class="math inline">\(E[\mu|V] \triangleq (\hat{\mu}_1, \ldots, \hat{\mu}_n)\)</span> and then select the “best” option based on the posterior means, <span class="math inline">\(k = \mbox{argmax}_i\, \hat{\mu}_i = \mbox{argmax}_i\, E[\mu_i|V]\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is the expected surprise under this model? To make things clear I will make it explicit as to what variables the expectations are over.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
E[\mu_k - \hat{\mu}_k] &amp;\triangleq E_{\mu, V}[\mu_k - \hat{\mu}_k] \\
&amp;= E_V[E_\mu[\mu_k - \hat{\mu}_k|V]]  \\
&amp;= E_V[E_\mu[\mu_k|V] - \hat{\mu}_k] \\
&amp;= E_V[\hat{\mu}_k  - \hat{\mu}_k] = 0
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The first line is just the definition of what we mean by average surprise. The second line uses the law of total expectation. The third line uses the fact that since <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_k\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, it is a constant when <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is fixed. The last line is from the definition of the posterior estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you use the posterior estimates of as your expectations of your future value and to select among your options, then your average surprise is zero. The Bayesian posterior expectation <em>shrinks</em> the esimates <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> towards the prior mean of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> which is what makes the procedure unbiased.</p>
<p>Depending of the distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(V|\mu)\)</span> the option that is selected by the Bayesian procedure (i.e., optimizing over <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}\)</span>) can be different from the one by optimizing over <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. For example, if we knew that the estimate with the largest maginitude, say <span class="math inline">\(v_j\)</span>, is very noisy, option <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> may no longer be selected after the shrinkage due to the posterior expectation. An option with a smaller but more accurate estimate may win out. Therefore, you not only have unbiased estimates of the value of the decisions you make, but you also <strong>make better decisions</strong>. (It can be shown that the Bayesian procedure is guaranteed to produce decisions with greater value on average than maximizing over the estimates, unless the two procedures produce identical decisions everytime.)</p>
<p><strong>Caveat Lector</strong>. There is a subtle sleight-of-hand in the proof of unbiasedness of the Bayesian procedure above. On the fourth line of the proof we said <span class="math inline">\(E_\mu[\mu_k|V] = \hat{\mu}_k\)</span>. Note that this expectation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is being conducted <em>by the universe</em>, whereas the expectation in <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_i = E[\mu_i|V]\)</span> to obtain the estimate was conducted <em>by you</em>. Therefore, as a quick simulation will verify, if your notion of the prior distribution on <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> differs from the universe’s, the guarantee of unbiasedness does not hold. Generally our belief about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> will flatter and wider (indicating our ignorance) than the true prior. In this case the optimizer’s bias is not completely eliminated even with the Bayesian procedure. In this case one could apply Smith and Winkler’s recommendation of a hierarchical prior, which results in the posterior estimates that shrink towards a weighted average of a global mean and the mean of the estimates <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_iv_i\)</span>.</p>
