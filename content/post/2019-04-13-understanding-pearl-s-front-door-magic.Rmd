_Wherein I try to present and intuitive account of causal reasoning and the important notion of the do-operator while avoiding some of the complexities of the do-calculus, d-separation and the like._

Imagine that we have a model of a physical phenomenon whose attributes of interest are $X$ and $Y$. For example $X$ could be temperature of mixture of gases and $Y$ could be rate of a chemical reaction between the gases.

We implement our model in program to simulate behaviors or instances of the phenomenon (joint samples of $(X, Y)$) as below

```{r}
model <- function(){
  x <- 20 * runif(1) + 50
  y <- exp(-50/x)
  return(data.frame(X=x, Y=y))
}
```
