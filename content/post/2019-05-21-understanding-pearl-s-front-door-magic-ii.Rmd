_Pearl's algorithmic framework for causal reasoning called __do-calculus__ can intimidate even a seasoned statistician. I will try to present an intuitive justification of a couple of its common patterns -- namely the back-door and, the seemingly magical, front-door adjustment formulas. Along the way I will derive the front-door formula (for a special case) using only the rules of probability_.

In a previous post I attempted to explain the distinction between _Bayesian_ and _causal_ (or _interventional_) conditioning by introducing the _do_ notation. In that solar panel washing story the scientist was able to construct a simulator for the data generating process, and answer interventional and counterfactual questions by appropriately manipulating the simulator. We cannot in general follow this procedure. In particular when not all variables are measured, even if we know the causal graph underlying the system under study, we will not be able to estimate all the mechanisms necessary to implement the simulator.  

Let us tell a different story to illustrate the problem. Imagine an intrepid statistician Ada working for a school district trying to answer the following question: will adding computer programming to the elementary school curriculum have a sufficiently beneficial effect on the students' math proficiency in middle school to justify the additional cost?

Ada obtains a compilation of grade-level curriculum and aggregated proficiency data for schools across the country. She notices in the data many elementary schools that offer optional after-school programming classes to their students. A quick analysis shows her that indeed the middle schools that are in neigborhoods where elementary schools offer these classes have higher standardized math scores. 

However, Ada suspects that part of the effect is due to a common cause: perhaps districts where schools offer the programming classes have more progressive administrators and their imaginative curriculum design independently benefits middle school math proficiency. Let us call this so-called _causal confounder_ "curriculum creativity" and denote it by the variable $C$. Further let us denote the optional elementary school programming classes by $P$, and middle school math proficiency by $M$. 

The causal diagram (the directed acyclic graph) that depicts Ada's causal hypotheses is
