<p><em>Judea Pearl’s brilliant algorithmic framework for causal reasoning called <strong>do-calculus</strong> can intimidate even a seasoned statistician. I will try to present an intuitive justification of a couple of its common patterns – namely the back-door and, the seemingly magical, front-door adjustment formulas. Along the way I will derive the front-door formula (for a special case) without appealing to the rules of do-calculus</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://modsimopt.netlify.com/post/2019/05/18/understanding-pearl-s-front-door-magic-part-i/">previous post</a> I attempted to explain the distinction between <em>Bayesian</em> and <em>causal</em> (or <em>interventional</em>) conditioning by introducing the <em>do</em> notation. In that solar panel washing story the scientist was able to construct a simulator for the data generating process, and answer interventional and counterfactual questions by appropriately manipulating the simulator. We cannot in general follow this procedure. In particular when not all variables are measured, even if we know the causal graph underlying the system under study, we will not be able to estimate all the mechanisms necessary to implement the simulator.</p>

<h2>Confounding and Controlling</h2>
<p>Let us tell a different story to illustrate the problem. Imagine an intrepid statistician Ada working for a school district trying to answer the following question: will adding computer programming to the elementary school curriculum have a sufficiently beneficial effect on the students’ math proficiency in middle school to justify the additional cost?</p>
<p>Ada obtains a compilation of grade-level curriculum and aggregated proficiency data for schools across the country. She notices in the data many elementary schools that offer optional after-school programming classes to their students. A quick analysis shows her that indeed the middle schools that are in neigborhoods where elementary schools offer these classes have higher standardized math scores.</p>
<p>However, Ada suspects that part of the effect is due to a common cause: perhaps districts where schools offer the programming classes have more progressive administrators and their imaginative curriculum design independently benefits middle school math proficiency. Let us call this so-called <em>causal confounder</em> “curriculum creativity” and denote it by the variable <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Further let us denote the availability of elementary school programming classes by <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and middle school math proficiency by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>The causal diagram (the directed acyclic graph) that depicts Ada’s causal hypotheses is</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-21-understanding-pearl-s-front-door-magic-ii_files/programming_example1.png" style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>She knows that if the data she has in her possession has measurements of curriculum creativity <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, she <em>should control</em> for that variable to accurately estimate the causal influence of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>What does such controlling entail? In the language of modern causal reasoning she wishes to estimate the interventional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M|do(P =p))\)</span>, i.e., the probability of math proficiency <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> if she were to intervene and <em>make</em> the programming class availability variable to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. (For the sake of our argument assume <span class="math inline">\(P \in \{\mbox{True, False}\}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>To generate an example from the world where we have intervened to <em>set</em> <span class="math inline">\(P=p\)</span> we first have to generate <span class="math inline">\(C = c\)</span> and then generate <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> according to the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(M | C=c, P=p)\)</span>. Therefore the joint distribution <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M, C=c|do(P=p))\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ Pr(M, C=c| do(P=p)) = Pr(M| C=c, P=p) Pr(C=c)\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore the interventional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M|do(P =p))\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[Pr(M|do(P =p)) = \sum_c Pr(M| C=c, P=p) Pr(C=c)\]</span>
For Ada’s problem, this is the <em>back-door formula</em>, and is precisely what she needs to calculate to control for the confounder <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. She needs to take a weighted average of the causal influence of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in each sub-population segre</p>
