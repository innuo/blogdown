<p><em>Wherein I try to present and intuitive account of causal reasoning and the important notion of the do-operator while avoiding some of the complexities of the do-calculus, d-separation and the like.</em></p>
<p>Imagine that we have a model of a physical phenomenon whose attributes of interest are <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. For example <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> could be temperature of mixture of gases and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> could be rate of a chemical reaction between the gases.</p>
<p>We implement our model in program to simulate behaviors or instances of the phenomenon (joint samples of <span class="math inline">\((X, Y)\)</span>) as below</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model &lt;- function(){
  x &lt;- 20 * runif(1) + 50
  y &lt;- exp(-50/x)
  return(data.frame(X=x, Y=y))
}</code></pre>
