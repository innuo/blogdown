      <description>div.blue pre.r { background-color:azure; } div.blue pre { background-color:#ffe2dd; }  My attempt to present an intuitive account of causal reasoning and the important notions of causal conditioning and counterfactuals without resorting to some of the formalities of do-calculus, d-separation, couterfactual notation and the like. All the programs in the post will be in R, but should be accessible to readers with no experience with the language.
Causal reasoning from scientific data has undergone a quiet revolution in the past couple of decades.</description>

      <description>Wherein I introduce and explain the well-studied mechanism behind the pervasive phenomenon in life of things being just a bit worse than expected. I will walk through some of the discussion in the excellent article, The Optimizerâ€™s Curse: Skepticism and Postdecision Surprise in Decision Analysis by Smith and Winkler.
Have you noticed that the checkout lanes you choose at the grocery store tend to be slower than you expected, the products you order off Amazon disappoint, and your second dates are not as exciting as your firsts?</description>

      <description>Wherein I present a simple example of a prediction problem modeled as inverse optimization and its formulation as a bilevel optimization problem, with a brief detour into Bayesian estimation.
Our story begins with Alice who runs a grocery store with a small selection of locally grown produce. Alice wishes to estimate the impacts of changing the prices of her produce on the purchase behavior of her customers and wonders if the data she has been collecting over the previous year can help.</description>
