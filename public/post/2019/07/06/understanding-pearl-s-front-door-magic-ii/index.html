<p><em>Do-calculus, Judea Pearl’s comprehensive algorithmic framework for causal reasoning, can intimidate even a seasoned statistician. I will try to present an intuitive justification of a couple of its common patterns – namely the back-door and, the seemingly magical, front-door adjustment formulas. Along the way I will derive the front-door formula (for a special case) without invoking the rules of do-calculus</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://modsimopt.netlify.com/post/2019/05/18/understanding-pearl-s-front-door-magic-part-i/">previous post</a> I attempted to explain the distinction between <em>Bayesian</em> and <em>causal</em> (or <em>interventional</em>) conditioning by introducing the <em>do</em> notation. In that solar panel washing story the scientist was able to construct a simulator for the data generating process, and answer interventional and counterfactual questions by appropriately manipulating the simulator. We cannot in general follow this procedure. In particular when not all variables are measured, even if we know the causal graph underlying the system under study, we will not be able to estimate all the mechanisms necessary to implement the simulator.</p>
<div id="confounding-and-controlling" class="section level2">
<h2>Confounding and Controlling</h2>
<p>Let us tell a different story to illustrate the problem. Imagine an intrepid statistician Ada working for a school district trying to answer the following question: will adding computer programming to the elementary school curriculum have a sufficiently beneficial effect on the students’ math proficiency in middle school to justify the additional cost?</p>
<p>Ada obtains a compilation of grade-level curriculum and aggregated proficiency data for school districts across the country. She notices in the data many elementary schools that offer optional after-school programming classes to their students. A quick analysis shows her that indeed the middle schools that are in neigborhoods where elementary schools offer these classes have higher standardized math scores.</p>
<p>However, Ada suspects that part of the effect is due to a common cause: perhaps districts where schools offer the programming classes have more progressive administrators and their imaginative curriculum design independently benefits middle school math proficiency. Let us call this so-called <em>causal confounder</em> “curriculum creativity” and denote it by the variable <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Further let us denote the availability of elementary school programming classes by <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and middle school math proficiency by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>The causal diagram (the directed acyclic graph) that depicts Ada’s causal hypotheses is</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-21-understanding-pearl-s-front-door-magic-ii_files/programming_example1.png" style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>She knows that if the data she has in her possession has measurements of curriculum creativity <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, she should <em>control</em> for that variable to accurately estimate the causal influence of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>What does such controlling entail? In the language of modern causal reasoning she wishes to estimate the interventional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M|do(P =p))\)</span>, i.e., the probability of math proficiency <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> if she were to intervene and <em>set</em> the programming class availability variable to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. (For the sake of our argument assume <span class="math inline">\(p \in \{\mbox{True, False}\}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>That is, to answer the causal query she needs to sever the causal link between <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> present in real-world process that generated her data, and hypothesize a data generating simulator that resembles the real-world process in all aspects but for that surgery.</p>
<p>To generate an example from the world where she had intervened to <em>set</em> <span class="math inline">\(P=p\)</span>, the hypothesized simulator first generates <span class="math inline">\(C = c\)</span> according to its prior, and then generates <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> according to the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(M | C=c, P=p)\)</span>. Therefore the joint distribution <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M, C=c|do(P=p))\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ Pr(M, C=c| do(P=p)) = Pr(M| C=c, P=p) Pr(C=c)\]</span></p>
<p>The interventional probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M|do(P =p))\)</span> is obtained by marginalizing out <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> from this expression as
<span class="math display">\[Pr(M|do(P =p)) = \sum_c Pr(M| C=c, P=p) Pr(C=c)\]</span>
For Ada’s problem, this is the <em>back-door formula</em>, and is precisely what she needs to calculate to <strong>control for the confounder</strong> <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>The path <span class="math inline">\(P \textrm{--} C \textrm{--} M\)</span> is called a <em>backdoor path</em> from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: an undirected path from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, with an arrow pointing into <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Such a <em>backdoor path</em> indicates possible confounding. To answer causal questions in a general causal graph, all <em>backdoor paths</em> need to be <em>blocked</em> by controlling for some set of variables <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> that satisfy the <em>backdoor criterion</em>, viz., every backdoor path must pass through some variable in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> should not include any descendent of the variable on which we are intervening.</p>
<p>(The above paragraph paraphrases <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch23.pdf">Cosma Shalizi’s lecture notes</a>, which present more thorough exposition of the topic and a formal derivation of the back-door formula.)</p>
</div>
<div id="unobserved-confounder" class="section level2">
<h2>Unobserved Confounder</h2>
<p>The reason <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> confounds the causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (and for needing to control for it) is because even if we observed a very strong correlation between <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> we cannot distinguish between a large causal effect of programming classes on math scores, and the effect being entirely due to the curriculum creativity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ada her data lacks any measurements of the creativity of the curriculum at different school districts (even if such a thing <em>could</em> be measured), leaving her in the hazy world of <em>unmeasured confounding</em> where she cannot apply the back-door formula to estimate the interventional probability. However, she notices that her data contains measurements of the student enrollment rates in the optional programming classes. She hypothesizes that the causal diagram including the enrollment variable <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> looks like so</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-21-understanding-pearl-s-front-door-magic-ii_files/programming_example_2.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>The above diagram encodes Ada’s causal story that math proficiency is affected by programming classes <em>only</em> through their corresponding enrollment rates, and that the enrollment rates themselves are not directly affected by curriculum creativity. Stated differently Ada assumes that 1) the enrollment rate <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> <em>blocks</em> the <em>only</em> causal path between <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, and 2) there are no backdoor paths from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, and 3) ???</p>
<p>From her causal story Ada reasons as follows.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though the data shows strong correlation between <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, not knowing <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> prevents me from distinguishing between the two extremes: 1) <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, i.e., there is no <em>direct</em> effect of curriculum creativity on math scores, and 2) <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, i.e., the entirety of the statistical dependence of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is due to the common parent <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> implying no causal effect of programming classes on math scores.</p>
<p>“However, if I should notice in the data that school districts that do not offer programming classes have similar math scores as the districts that do but have zero enrollment, I would know that of curriculum creativity <em>did not</em> cause the high math scores in districts with programming classes and high enrollment. In other words, the measurement of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> would help me distinguish between the above two extremes, even though <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> was not measured!”</p>
<p>Formally, what Ada realized is that, under the model defined by her causal graph, the interventional probablity <span class="math inline">\(Pr(M|do(P))\)</span> can be written in terms of the joint distribution over the variables <span class="math inline">\(P, E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, magically deconfounding causal question.</p>
