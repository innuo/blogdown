      <description>Do-calculus, Judea Pearl’s comprehensive algorithmic framework for causal reasoning, can intimidate even a seasoned statistician. I will try to present an intuitive justification of a couple of its common patterns – namely the back-door and, the seemingly magical, front-door adjustment formulas. Along the way I will derive the front-door formula (for a special case) from the back-door formula without invoking the rules of do-calculus.
In a previous post I attempted to explain the distinction between Bayesian and causal (or interventional) conditioning by introducing the do notation.</description>
