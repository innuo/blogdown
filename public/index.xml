      <description>Wherein I introduce and explain the well-studied mechanism behind the pervasive phenomenon in life of things being just a bit worse than expected. I will walk through some of the discussion in two excellent articles, The Optimizerâ€™s Curse: Skepticism and Postdecision Surprise in Decision Analysis by Smith and Winkler and Estimating the Maximum Expected Value: An Analysis of (Nested) Cross Validation and the Maximum Sample Average by van Hasselt.</description>

      <description>Wherein I present a simple example of a prediction problem modeled as inverse optimization and its formulation as a bilevel optimization problem, with a brief detour into Bayesian estimation.
Our story begins with Alice who runs a grocery store with a small selection of locally grown produce. Alice wishes to estimate the impacts of changing the prices of her produce on the purchase behavior of her customers and wonders if the data she has been collecting over the previous year can help.</description>
